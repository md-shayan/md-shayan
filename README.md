- I’m currently learning *data structures and algorithms using C/C++* and **once I have a good grasp in them and the theory behind how a software is developed and other CS subject such as OS, DBMS and Networking, I would like to do my own research in the field and make my own projects.**
- I'll be happy to help you out in any project which is related to my knowledge.
